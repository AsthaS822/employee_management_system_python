Since you are using it, we'll assume Anaconda/Miniconda is installed.Activate your environment (if not already active):Bashconda activate base
# OR if you created a separate environment, use that name
InstallationNo external libraries (like requests or pandas) are needed, as this project uses the standard Tkinter library, which is included with most Python installations (including Anaconda).Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_LINK]
cd EmployeeManagementSystemPython
Ensure Tkinter is available: Tkinter is usually included, but if you get an error, you may need to install it manually:Bashconda install tk
Running the ApplicationExecute the main Python script directly from your terminal:Bashpython employeemanagementsystem.py
